# Bamazon

In this project I created an Amazon-like storefront with MySQL called **Bamazon**. The app takes in orders form customers and deminishes the quantity in stock from the store's inventory as the customer orders product.

# Getting Started
The customer will be presented with a list of inventory items.
At the same time the customer will be prompted what they would like to purchase.
Once the customer makes a choice, they will be asked how many they would like to purchase.
The customer will be informed what they ordered and the quantity they ordered.
The customer will also be informed if there is or if there is not enough inventory for the purchase.
